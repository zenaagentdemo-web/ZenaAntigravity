Insights & Reasoning**\nThe data indicates a clear bifurcation in the Point Chevalier market. Entry-level 3-bedroom units or unrenovated homes on smaller cross-lease sites are moving between **$1.1M and $1.4M**. However, the 'Gold Standard' Pt Chev bungalow—renovated with 2 bathrooms and decent indoor-outdoor flow—is consistently clearing the **$1.9M to $2.1M** mark. The sale at 59 Walker Road is your strongest current anchor for a standard full-site 3-bedroom home.\n\n#### **5. Value Bracket**\nBased on current stock and recent settled sales, a standard 3-bedroom dwelling in Point Chevalier currently sits within:\n**$1,750,000 – $2,150,000**\n*(Note: Premium waterfront or architectural new builds will exceed this range).* \n\n#### **6. Suggested Next Steps**\nTo tighten this range, I recommend a physical walkthrough to assess the 'character premium' and school zone proximity.
